- 👉 http://eddysites.wuaze.com/ (This is a Laravel framework based website that features a Daycare educational center. I am still working on the admin dashboard which when completed should be able to allow users to update content right on the website. The website contains some text information that was generated by chatGPT3. The site uses Laravel Seeders to injected data into a MYSQLite database file. All images used on this website were downloaded from https://stockcake.com/. If you like the project and would like the source code feel free to email me.
